   * - FelooPy
     - |image:: miscellaneous/logo/logo1.png
       | FelooPy (pronounced /fÉ›lupaÉª/) is a free and open-source Python library for automated operations research that serves as both a hyper-optimization interface and an integrated optimization environment. The name comes from the idea of suggesting practical and applicable solutions for systems, industries, and supply chains, and it also references the importance of loops in programming and algorithm development, and draws similarities to the name "Floppy" to highlight memory efficiency. FelooPy helps operations research scientists achieve their goals using various target, representor, and learner models. In simple words, FelooPy is a unified framework for optimization algorithms, decision-making methods, and modeling and analytical tools.

**Installation**
##############################

FelooPy can be installed on Linux-based distributions, Windows, or macOS. It has a few dependencies that should work on all these platforms.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description
     - Requirements
   * - Quick
     - ``pip install --upgrade feloopy``
     - Python >= 3.10
   * - PyPI
     - ``pip install feloopy==0.2.5``
     - Python >= 3.10

.. note::

   FelooPy requires Python 3.10 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, or if you have an older version, you can download it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can create a new environment with Python 3.10 or later and install FelooPy in that environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create --name feloopy python=3.10
      conda activate feloopy
      pip install feloopy

   FelooPy (v0.2.5) has a few optional dependencies that can be installed using the following commands:

   * All solvers: ``pip install feloopy[all_solvers]``
   * Gurobi: ``pip install feloopy[gurobi]``
   * Cplex: ``pip install feloopy[cplex]``
   * Xpress: ``pip install feloopy[xpress]``
   * Linux: ``pip install feloopy[linux]`` (better support for multi-objective optimization)

   For multi-objective optimization, you should use the linux command for installation. However, please note that the optional dependencies for Linux kernel might not work on some operating systems. As a workaround, you can use a Conda-based Python 3.10 interpreter to ensure that optional dependencies for multi-objective optimization are installed correctly.
