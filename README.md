| ![Image description](logo/logo1.png) | FelooPy (pronounced /fɛlupaɪ/) is a free and open-source Python library for automated operations research that serves as both a hyper-optimization interface and an integrated optimization environment. The name comes from the idea of suggesting practical and applicable solutions. It also references the importance of loops in programming and algorithm development, and draws similarities to the name "Floppy" to highlight memory efficiency. FelooPy helps operations research scientists achieve their goals using various target, representor, and learner models, shifting their focus from coding to modeling and analytics. _Quick install_: `pip install --upgrade feloopy`|
